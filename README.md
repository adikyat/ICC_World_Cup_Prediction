# ICC_World_Cup_Prediction
This application will basically predict the winner of a match based on previous statistical data.
Algorithm used is Random Forest. We have done this for education purpose (POC). We have no owner rights on the code, we have done this for our self-learning.

## Details :- 

- results.csv = Results of matches performed between different teams, this is used as training data
- Based on results of past matches , we can predict the upcoming matches.
- This model is deployed on Heroku where we need to input the teams which are going to play and it will output the likely winner.
- Model performance = Training set accuracy:  70.2%, Test set accuracy:  61.5% , the model has high variance and also its underfit but, we could perform hyperparamter optimization to develop the model performance. 
- The goal of this project was understand end to end machine learning pipeline.
